# Conflict Plan

**Group process to resolve conflict:**

If there's a conflict between two members, bring the issue up to another member of the group to mediate.

**What to do if one person starts taking over:**

Have a whole-group meeting to discuss what's happening and why.

**How to approach each other and the challenges of the project:**

Be sure to observe the 15-minute rule and ask for help when needed. No judgment! Just ask!

**How will we raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

Have a whole-group meeting to discuss what's happening and why.

**How and when will we escalate the conflict if resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

If whole-group meetings are unsuccessful at resolving conflict, bring in an instructor to mediate and give advice/help.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

Utilize the 15-minute rule: ask for help. If we are falling behind as a team, we will reassess our goals and priorities, and potentially bring in help from instructors. MPV!

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?**

Everyone speaks in the daily stand-up. Delegation: being sure everyone has equitable tasks.
Concensus voting for any big issues.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

LISTEN when other group members are speaking - let teammates finish thoughts before speaking up/interjecting.

## Git Process

All team members will be administrators on the project's repository. All of the project's code live in GitHub.
Other resources will be accessed as needed from their sources.

Our initial feeling about using branches is to create branches off of the main branch as needed to handle different tasks within the process.

PR Review workflow:
A-C-P will happen as often as necessary
PRs will be discussed at stand-up meetings
The team will decide who is delegated the task of merging PRs and handling merge conflicts on a daily basis
